( This program 'cleans' ^! files by removing all comments and non-instruction characters.
|
| The general approach is to read characters from stdin and compare them against the
| list of ^! instructions, printing those that match. The complication comes from block
| comments, which must be balanced and ignored.
|   For these, the auxiliary stack is used, since comments have LIFO behaviour. Every '('
| encountered pushes a dummy value (0) to aux, and ')' pops a value from aux. Then, if aux
| is non-empty, the instructions are checked. Otherwise, nothing is printed.
